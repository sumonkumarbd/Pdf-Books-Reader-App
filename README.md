## Overview
The **The Reader Ebook App** is built to deliver a seamless reading experience on Android, letting users enjoy PDF and DOCX files with a modern, customizable twist. As the developer, I wanted to create a clean, engaging platform that makes reading accessible and fun for everyone, whether itâ€™s a novel or a study guide.

This app supports versatile file formats, offers personalised themes, bookmarks, text search, and smooth navigation, ensuring users stay connected to their content effortlessly.

## Features

- **Customizable Themes**: Users can switch between light, dark, or custom themes to match their reading preferences.
- **Bookmarks**: Save favourite pages for quick access, making it easy to pick up where you left off.
- **Text Search**: Quickly find specific words or phrases within documents for efficient studying or reference.
- **Smooth Navigation**: Intuitive controls for zooming, scrolling, and page-flipping enhance the reading flow.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **IDE**: Android Studio
